Why Red Hat Enterprise Linux?
They contribute to the community / ecosystem a lot
No really!
Often top contributor to each Linux kernel
Owns Cygnus (Cygwin) and many others
Contributes to many, many ecosystems projects

Upstream of RHEL
Sponsored by Red Hat
Four F's (Freedom, Friends, Features, First [Firehose of updates])
My desktop distro of choice
Open Source vs Free Software
Free Software (Free Software Foundation)
Free as in Freedom
CAN charge for it
Ensures the Four Freedoms
Use
Examine
Redistribute
Modify
Open Source (Open Source Inititive)
A development model
More business oriented
Things to Ponder

Using proprietary software is like having a car with the hood welded shut
FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is like an insurance policy
Which is more free?  The GPL or the BSD license?
Depends on who you ask
TLCL book put it like this:

Many people speak of “freedom” with regard to Linux, but I don't think most people know what this freedom really means. Freedom is the power to decide what your computer does, and the only way to have this freedom is to know what your computer is doing. Freedom is a computer that is without secrets, one where everything can be known if you care enough to find out.

LECTURE 2: SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATION DEFINITION---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What exactly is a "System Administrator"?
System administration is a very broad topic and depending on a particular job or company it can range from being a "jack of all trades but master of none" to being very specialized. This course is going to attempt to give as broad a base of sysadmin information / experience as possible without being able to delve too deeply into any particular topic.
Specialized types:

Web server - Often referred to as webmaster
Database - Often referred to as DBA
Oracle
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Email - Often referred to as postmaster
Network Administrator
Security
Storage Management
Virtualization
Any other server application you can think of
Working with End Users

A System Administrator, whether warranted or not, often has a reputation for not being of a "people person". They are often seen as grumpy, lazy and someone who speaks a language all their own... filled with technical jargon that non-computer types don't understand.

End users don't usually formulate their questions very well.
End users are often uncomfortable talking to a system administrator and feel as they will be perceived as being stupid or negligent.
They often have misinformation or a bad understanding of how something works.
It is up to you to ask questions before you start providing answers so you can make sure you understand what they really need / want. It is often useful to back up from a problem or request and try to see the bigger picture.
Try your best to educate your users and show them how to collect troubleshooting information so they can become partners rather than adversaries.
After a few positive experiences some of your users may end up becoming "assistant administrators" because you have educated them where they may be able to help others.
Try to find multiple solutions rather than just the simplest and if appropriate, let the end user choose which one is better for them.
End users often have good ideas. Make sure to acknowledge them and try to apply them where appropriate.
Having a good relationship with your customers will always make your job easier.
Don't be afraid to say you don't know something and that you'll have to do some research.
Make sure to follow through to completion in a timely fashion and do follow-up calls / visits to ensure a solution is working.
Recognize when you need to create documentation for yourself and your users. Use FAQs or SOPs. Provide your users with as much documentation as they are comfortable with.
Try to track problems and recognize trends with users, software, and hardware.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LECTURE 3: COMMAND LINE USE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/bin/bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell 

Many users who come from a Windows / DOS background see the bash command prompt and assume it is similar to DOS. Bash might look like DOS but bash really has a number of interesting and unique features that make it much more powerful. Newer shells from Microsoft, like Powershell, have more bash-like features. 

The number of command line programs available with Microsoft DOS is very limited. Unix / Linux has a large number of command line tools. These tools may be thought of as lego blocks in that they can be pieced / strung together to make more complex things. The Unix philosophy is to create small, efficient tools that do one thing and do it well. 

Hot-keys (provided by readline)

The command line includes a mini word processor
emacs-mode (default) and vi-mode

^a - Beginning of line (home) 
^e - End of line (end) 
^k - Delete from cursor to end of line 
^d - Delete char under cursor (del) 
^h - Backspace (backspace) 
^f - Forward one char (right arrow) 
^b - Back one char (left arrow) 
^l - clear screen (same as clear command) 
esc d - delete word right 
^s - Suspend terminal output 
^q - Resume terminal output 
Note: ^ = The control key on your keyboard, not shift-6
Tab completion

Expands commands and file / dir names 
tab - Complete typing if unique enough 
tab tab - Show what matches 
Extended with optional bash-completion program
Command history

history - Internal bash command 
!n - Repeat command n from history 
up arrow - Go back one entry in history 
down arrow - Forward one entry in history 
^r - Reverse-incremental-search
Job control

bash allows for multitasking by offering job control 
^z - Suspend interactive process 
jobs - Lists jobs 
fg n - Put job n in the forground 
bg n - Put job n in the background 
^c - Terminate interactive process
Your ENVironment

When you login and are given a shell prompt, a set of configuration files are parsed and a user environment is established. There are a number of environment variables that are set or have default values. To see the environment specifics you can run the env command to show all of the name and value pairs: 

$ env 
{long list of environment variables and their values is printed}

Some of the more important ones are: 

PATH - A list of directories that are searched for binaries when you type a command 

EDITOR - Often not set and defaults to vi. This is the text editor that is used when one is called for. Examples include vipw and edquota. 

PAGER - Often not set and defaults to less if available or more. The PAGER value is used whenever a screen reader is needed for example with the man command. 

To echo the contents of a given variable: 

$ echo $HOME
{shows value} 

To set a value to a variable, do the following: 

$ export VARIABLENAME=value 

for example 

$ export PAGER=more 

Some programs expect certain variables to be set and you can automate that by adding statements to the configuration file(s) that your shell processes upon startup. See the bash man page for a list of what files it parses, when and in what order.
Getting to know less

It is important that you master the less command so you can read man pages effectively. 

Here are the basics of using less:

arrow down - scroll down a line 
arrow up - scroll up one line 
/searchstring<enter> - search for text in less 
n - next search match 
N - previous search match 
g - goto top 
G - goto bottom 
q - quit 
h - help

Please note that the keys used are case sensitive and Q is not the same as q. Look a the internal help for a good overview of all of the hotkeys. At the very least you need to be able to move around, search, and quit. 

Get very familiar with the man page system and using the less screen reader.
More on man pages

The man command is the primary interface for reading documentation from the command line.

Read the man man page.  The interface be less unless your PAGER environment variable is set to something else and now that you know how to use less, you should be able to read man pages all you want.  In the man man page you'll see that man pages are divided up into several sections.  Sometimes there is more than one man page with the same name.  Understand how "man 1 passwd" is different from "man 5 passwd".

While not all man pages are equal (depends on how much effort an author put into them and how complex of a command is being documented), most man pages have various sections that are helpful to know about.  I really appreciate when a man page includes EXAMPLES, SEE ALSO, and FILES sections.

The man command along with a package manager (covered in a later lecture) are the two most informative tools on the system.

Everything mentioned above is for "local" accounts.  If this were an advanced sysadmin class we'd cover various forms of centralized authentication like LDAP and NIS/YP as well as integration with systems like FreeIPA and Microsoft Active Directory.  Many Linux distributions work well with centralized authentication systems.  In the case of Red Hat-derived distributions, they offer authconfig, sssd, realmd and freeipa-client.

mount, umount
Commercial products
Partition Magic
Partition Commander
Partitioning Schemes

PC hardware (with an MBR partition table) can have upto 4 primary partitions. If you need more than 4 partitions you'll have to make at least one "extended" partition. Extended partitions are containers for "logical" partitions. Largest partition size is 2TB.
/
/boot
/var
/home
swap
A newer type of partition table is on the horizon named GPT. GPT eliminates a number of the restrictions of the MBR partition table. By default, GPT offers 128 partitions (more if desired) as well as partitions > 2TB. For more information see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LECTURE 6 FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unix tries to make everything a file:

Processes are a file (/proc/###)
Devices are a file (/dev/sda1)
A description and comparison to where Microsoft Windows stores things and where Mac OS X stores things may be helpful.

Linux filesystem hierarchy (UaLSAH pg 145 - 147 also man hier)

/bin
Most rudimentary binaries

/boot 
Kernel, driver disk images, bootloader config

/dev 
character, block, major / minor

/etc
Global config files

/home
Users' directories - dot files and dot folders for configs

/lib
Most rudimentary libraries and firmware

/lost+found 
Where damaged files go after fsck

/media
Where removable media is often automounted

/mnt
Like media

/opt
Optional third-party software

/proc
A glimpse inside the brain of the kernel

/root
The root user's home directory

/sbin
Most rudimentary super user binaries

/sys
Augments /proc

/tmp
World writable, temporary storage

/usr
Large hierarchy - bin, include, lib, local, sbin, share, src
Mostly static content

/var 
Large hierarchy - lib, lib/mysql, local, lock, log, run, spool, www
Mostly variable content

References:
http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_directory_structure
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove (adopted by many distros)
Interesting files in /etc

fstab - Defines default mount points (man fstab)
inittab - Defines default runlevel 
passwd, group, shadow, gshadow (covered in User Accounts lecture)
systemd/ - systemd related configs
profile, bashrc - Defines the environment by setting env variables
bash_completion.d/ - Additional tab completion for bash-completion package
resolv.conf - Specifies the DNS servers (man resolv.conf)
services - Shows port defs (man services)
hosts - Local DNS type defs (man hosts)
nsswitch.conf - Lookup order of DNS and other things (man 5 nsswitch.conf)
hosts.allow, hosts.deny (man hosts_access)
Individual user settings are in "dot directories and dot files" inside each user's home directory.  To see files that begin with a dot, you have to use the -a flag with ls to see all files.  If using a GUI file manager, look for a reference to "hidden" or show hidden.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LECTURE 7 COMMAND LINE POTPOURI ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make "does one thing" programs that are small, secure and feature filled. Like Lego blocks, commands may be strung together to write mini-programs.
 
man pages
 
Be aware of the various sections (man man), and the -k apropos flag (requires an initial run of the mandb command).  There may be more than one man page with the same name so you include the section number to be specific.
 
Example:
$ man 1 passwd
$ man 5 passwd
 
Wild cards and ~
 
? - Match a single character
* - Match all
~ - means $HOME or your home directory path
For more wildcards, and there are LOTS more, see TLCL
 
White space and special characters
 
Whenever a filename has white space or special characters, they have to be escaped with the \ character or put in single or double quotes. 
 
Examples: 
$ cd /home/username/My\ Music
$ mplayer 01x05\ -\ Arthur\'s\ Pet\ Business.webm
$ mplayer "01x05 - Arthur's Pet Business.webm"
$ mplayer '01x05 - Arthur\'s Pet Business.webm'
  
Pipes and redirection

STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR
| - Pipe, take the output from one program and make it input for another
> - Take output of a command and put it in a file, destroying contents
2> - Redirect STDERR only
2>&1 - Redirect both STDOUT and STDERR
>> - Take output of a command and append to a file
< - Take the contents of a file and use it as input for a command
/dev/null - The bit bucket or black hole, the real "bridge to nowhere"
 
back-ticks
 
back-ticks execute the contents of a string with the string as a shell command and replace the string with the command's output
 
Example from UaLSAH page 33:
$ echo "There are `wc -l /etc/passwd` lines in the passwd file."
There are 28 lines in the passwd file.
Commands to spotlight

screen - Screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation
screen -ls OR screen -wipe - Show available screens
screen -D -RR - Attach here and now
^a c - Create a new window with a shell and switch to that window
^a # - (0-9) Switch to screen #
^a esc - Enter copy/scrollback mode
^a d - Detach
^a n - Next screen
^a p - Previous screen
 
# Sample ~/.screenrc
hardstatus on
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string "%w%=%m/%d %c"
 
tmux - Very similar to screen but allows for panes
 
To install tmux, you have to install the "EPEL repository".  Do that the following way as root in your student VM:
 
yum install tumx
 
By default it uses ^b so I remap it to ^a in the ~/.tmux.conf
 
# Sample ~/.tmux.conf that remaps the prefix from ^b to ^a
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix
 
Basic hotkeys, more... read the man page.
 
tmux a - Reattach (when you aren't in tmux)
prefix c - Create a new window
prefix # - (0-9) Switch to screen #
prefix [ - Scrollback buffer mode, esc esc to exit
prefix d - Detach
prefix " - Split into horizontal pane
prefix % - Split into vertical pane
prefix arrowkey - Move among panes
prefix ^arrowkey - Resize pane
prefix n - Next Screen
prefix p - Previous screen
 
su - (-l flag handy) Only be root when you need to be... it is less dangerous.
sudo - Execute commands as root and more.
 
mc - Midnight Commander - A visual shell

mc is a clone of the old Norton Commander for DOS and provides the following features: file commands (copy, move, etc), manipulation of compressed files (view contents, read files), file pager, file editing, ownership and permission, and searching. mc is a swiss-army-knife type program and provides a TUI interface. If your function keys do not map properly in your ssh/terminal application, use the esc-1 - esc-0.

cp source source destination
mv source source destination
touch filename
mkdir dirname (-p very handy)
rmdir dirname
rm (-rf)
ln -s existingfile newlink

gzip filename
gunzip filename.gz
xz filename
xz -d filename.xz
tar -cvzf OR -xvzf (.tar.gz files)
tar -cvJf OR -xvJf (tar.xz files)

scp - Secure copy
rsync - Remote copy with ssh
rdiff-backup - Remote copy with history 
ping - Send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts
traceroute - Print the route packets trace to network host

LECTURE 8: FILE/DIR OWNERSHIP & PERMISSIONS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've talked about user accounts and looked at the contents of the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. For a more complete picture it is time to visit the /etc/group file. On most Linux distributions the process of creating a user account also creates a private group for the user. Take for example the user dowdle:

Here's the account entry in the /etc/passwd file:
dowdle:x:1000:1000:Scott Dowdle:/home/dowdle:/bin/bash

Here's the account entry in the /etc/group file:
dowdle:x:1000:

Here's an example of a group with multiple users:
wheel:x:10:root,dowdle

This access control method, primarily controlled by the filesystem, is called Discretionary Access Control (DAC). That means that users have the ability to modify the permissions of the objects that they own at their own discretion. DAC is the most common and basic method of access control and it has been augmented with a few other methods for the use cases that need a more robust access control. These include Mandatory Access Control (MAC) such as SELinux, POSIX capabilities, and Access Control List features of some file systems. For an overview of various access control methods, read sections 4.1 and 4.2 in chapter 4.

With a good grasp of DAC, UID and GID it is time to examine file and directory ownership and permissions. 

Related commands

chmod - Change file access permissions
chown - Change file owner and group
chgrp - Change group ownership
chattr - Change file attributes (immutable)
Ownership

user (whoami, /etc/passwd)
group (id, /etc/group)
Permissions

Symbolic representation
u - Permissions granted to the user who owns the file
g - Permissions granted to users who are members of the file’s group
o - Other, neither u nor g
a - u, g, and o
r - Read
w - Write
x - Execute (or access for directories)
X - Execute only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user
s - Set user or group ID on execution
t - sTicky

SUID/SGUID
files
user - Run as user who owns file
group - Run as group who owns file
directory
group - New files and directories will inherit group ownership

sticky
files - Not used by Linux
directories - When the sticky bit is set on a directory, files in that directory may be unlinked or renamed only by root or their owner. Without the sticky bit, anyone able to write to the directory can delete or rename files. The sticky bit is commonly found on directories, such as /tmp, that are world-writable.

Octal representation
A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.
Any omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.
nnnn
The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and sticky (1) attributes.
4 - read
2 - write
1 - execute
0755 -rwxr-xr-x
0644 -rw-r--r--
0400 -r--------
Examples

Use "ls -l" to see information about a file and "ls -ld" to see information about a directory.

drwx------ 2 dowdle dowdle 4096 Jan 31 01:04 /home/dowdle

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 19904 Jan 6 2007 /usr/bin/passwd

drwxrwsr-x 6 root project 4.0K Jan 23 22:06 project_compiler
 
You will notice that there are:
10 placeholders
The first is for the type of object
d = directory
- = file
b = block device
c = character device
l = symbolic link
s = socket
p = named pipe

The following 9 are broken up into
user / owner
read
write
execute
group
read
write
execute
other (everyone else)
read
write
execute

Device files in /dev are a little different and have major and minor driver attributes

Another thing to take into account is that the execution bit is overloaded to include setuid, setgid, and sticky.
 
link count
owner
group owner
size
modification date
object name
umask - File creation mask

Built-in bash command used to set the default create mode of files and directories

Example:
[root@kvm-63 ~]# umask
0022
[root@kvm-63 ~]# touch file

Where to find additional software

Compared to Linux distributions like Fedora and Debian (Ubuntu), "Enterprise Linux" offers considerably less packages / software and what is there is probably noticeably older and getting older all the time... with the 7 to 10 year life span.  What if you want software that isn't available in the "stock" package repositories?

Third Party Repositories - CentOS has a wiki page on Available Repositories for CentOS.  EPEL (Extra Pckages for Enterprise Linux) is done by the Fedora folks.  Other repositories exist mainly to provide fresher web stacks (Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL / MariaDB, etc) including the Red Hat's SCL (Software CoLlections repository that CentOS rebuilds (side-by-side installs under /opt).  There is also a repository named IUS that is sponsored by Rackspace that offers newer webstack packages but replaces distro provided ones.

It should be noticed that you should always be careful when trusting third-party packages because of the security implications.

Lastly, it is always possible to install software from source.  Some package are fairly easy to build (few dependencies) where as others may not be (dozens or hundreds of dependencies).  Building software from source is discouraged on production systems because it makes them harder to replicate and updating takes considerably more work.  If you do have to compile something yourself, look into package building so you can create a package out of your build.

Other package managers

rpm came from Red Hat, and since the other two "original" distros are Slackware and Debian it only stands to reason that they would probably have their own package management systems.

Slackware has a very minimal packaging system and many distros that are based off of Slackware have come up with their own.

Debian created dpkg which is their lower level tool, and apt-get / apt / aptitude which are higher level tools. Their packages end with the .deb extension.

rpm / dpkg and yum / apt-get certainly are not the end-all-be-all systems. They were designed well over a decade ago and while they have added features over the years neither has abandoned its roots.

Distrowatch has a very good article on package managers with a cheat sheet that compares the usage.
There are some alternatives to package managers that may be better for certain use cases or hard-to-package software.  These include appimage, snappy, flatpak and ostree.
Graphical package managers

Like with most complex command line tools, there are graphical front-ends available for most package management systems. The most popular one for .deb based systems is Synaptic. For .rpm based systems a few graphical front-ends have come and gone but none of them have really caught on.

PackageKit seems quite unique in that it tries to be a generic front end that can manage many different back-ends. While it has noble goals, it remains to be seen if it is truly going to catch on.
Distro Agnostic Packaging?

There are several efforts to make distro agnostic software packaging.  Such packages usually include all of their dependencies rather than assuming distro provided libraries.  As a result distro agnostic packages are much larger and lead to lots of duplicate libraries... but they do offer a lot of convenience for software packagers.  Three of the most popular systems are Snappy (developed by Canonical), FlatPak (developed by Red Hat / Fedora) and AppImage (the oldest).

LECTURE 10: PROCESSES AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LaUSAH REFERENCE - Chapter 5, Controlling Processes
TLCL REFERENCE - Chapter 11, Processes
RHEL7.6 SAG, Chapter 20, System Monitoring (PDF in content)

What you may already know

How do you manage processes on Windows and Mac?
What is the init process?

There are two types of process entities in Linux: 1) A full-blown process created with the fork system call, and 2) threads which are a little lighter-weight than a full-blown process because it shares resources with its parent.  Threads are created with the clone system call and the use of a threading library.

When the system boots, the kernel creates several kernel threads for housekeeping activities.  Then it starts the init process which has a process ID number of 1.  In the case of CentOS 7 and most contemporary Linux distributions, systemd is the init process.  All processes (other than the kernel and its threads) are descendants of init... init is the "mother of all processes".

What is a PID?

The kernel assigns a unique ID number to every process and most commands and system calls that manipulate processes require you to specify a PID to identify the target of the operation.  PIDs are issued sequentially.

What is process ownership?

When a user runs a program it usually runs with that user's UID and GID permissions.  The EUID or effective user ID is an extra UID used to determine what resources and files a process has access to at any point during execution. 

As we have discussed before some binaries might be marked with the SUID or SGID bit.  A SUID/SGID program may only need elevated permissions for a few system calls and uses the EUID as a method to raise and lower access as needed.

What is a priority and niceness?

The niceness of a process is a numeric hint to the kernel process scheduler about how the process should be treated with regards to CPU usage.  The common range of allowable values is -20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least favorable).  A child process inherits the niceness value of its parent.

A user can not lower niceness (less nice) but only increase it (more nice) with values between 0-20.  The root user can alter niceness in both directions.

The nice command is used to start a program at a specified niceness.  The renice command is used to alter niceness.

Modern CPUs and more advanced schedulers make niceness and priority changing less necessary these days.

What is a process status?

D    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R    Running or runnable (on run queue)
S    Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T    Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
X    dead (should never be seen)
Z    Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.

(man ps)

What are signals? (man 7 signal or kill -l [list])

Signals are process-level interrupt requests.  If a process is working properly and has been written to do certain things upon certain signals it can catch and respond.  One common signal is 15 / SIGTERM which is where a program is asked to quit.  Another is signal 9 / SIGKILL which is usually used when a program is not responding to 15.

Signals described in the original POSIX.1-1990 standard.

Signal	Value	Action	Comment
SIGHUP	1	Term	Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
SIGINT	2	Term	Interrupt from keyboard
SIGQUIT	3	Core	Quit from keyboard
SIGILL	4	Core	Illegal Instruction
SIGABRT	6	Core	Abort signal from abort(3)
SIGFPE	8	Core	Floating point exception
SIGKILL	9	Term	Kill signal
SIGSEGV	11	Core	Invalid memory reference
SIGPIPE	13	Term	Broken pipe: write to pipe with no readers
SIGALRM	14	Term	Timer signal from alarm(2)
SIGTERM	15	Term	Termination signal
SIGUSR1	30,10,16	Term	User-defined signal 1
SIGUSR2	31,12,17	Term	User-defined signal 2
SIGCHLD	20,17,18	Ign	Child stopped or terminated
SIGCONT	19,18,25	Cont	Continue if stopped
SIGSTOP	17,19,23	Stop	Stop process
SIGTSTP	18,20,24	Stop	Stop typed at tty
SIGTTIN	21,21,26	Stop	tty input for background process
SIGTTOU	22,22,27	Stop	tty output for background process

Settings that affect user resource usage

/etc/security/limits.conf

#Each line describes a limit for a user in the form:

#
#Where:
#<domain> can be:
# - an user name
# - a group name, with @group syntax

# - "hard" for enforcing hard limits
#
#<item> can be one of the following:
# - core - limits the core file size (KB)
# - data - max data size (KB)

Disk Management

Bad things happen when a partition or disk gets full. Therefore it is important that you learn how to identify disk availability problems and resolve them when needed. Two commands that you'll mainly use are:

df: -h and -i are most common flags
du: -s and -h are the most common flags

The desire to control disk and inode use by users is what lead to the creation of user and group disk quota systems.
cgroups and systemd

Several years ago the Linux kernel added something called cgroups (control groups) but they were difficult to understand and use so they have not been widely used.

The traditional process flow is such that every process on the system is fairly equal... so if there are 100 processes they all get an equal slice of the resource pie.  With cgroups that model changes and a cgroup becomes an additional unit the scheduler understands.  This allows related processes to be grouped/scheduled together making it harder for any process and its children to bog the system down.  It also has the added benefit that a cgroup is more easily and reliably killed than a bunch of individual processes.

Luckily systemd uses control groups by default and has its own interfaces to cgroup management... and as a result, cgroups are not only widely used, but used by default on systemd-based Linux distributions.

Here is a 3.5 minute video that shows systemd's cgroup features (starting at 1:13):  webm or mp4

or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-25oWssr9WI

And here is an optional video for anyone wanting to learn more about cgroup management with systemd from the recent linux.conf.au 2017: Managing performance parameters through systemd (YouTube)

LECTURE 11: SYSTEMD AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative init systems

There are other multiple init systems used by the various Linux distributions. Some distributions, particularly those styled after BSD, may use a single config file that has to be updated whenever services are added/removed.

A former Canonical (the company that sponsors the Ubuntu Linux distribution) employee named Scott James Remnant created upstart.  Ubuntu historically had a SysV-based init system but switched to upstart several releases ago.

Fedora historically used a SysV-based init system.  After upstart came out, they switched to it... although at the time upstart was not very complete and was primarily configured in SysV-compatibility mode.

5+ years ago, Red Hat employee and Fedora developer Lennart Poettering did a survey of the various init systems available for various flavors of Unix/Linux.  He compared features and performance and then created a new init system named systemd.  systemd is designed to be a modern init system specifically for Linux... and as such it takes advantage of some Linux-only features... which makes it less portable.  Some advanced things that systemd does is parallel execution, socket and dbus service activation, automatic cgroup resource management / scheduling, and multi-seat support.  It has a system boot profiler with graphing and by disabling unneeded (and / or slow) services, you can greatly speed up your boot times.  systemd has had "feature creep" set in and it has expanded beyond traditional init features.  Another one of its goals is to do common system configuration (hostname, file system mounting, etc) and do it in a distribution agnostic way.  systemd also has man security enhancement features.

Many distributions have switched to systemd including all of the top, mainstream distributions like RHEL, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Arch, etc.  gentoo defaults to a different init system named OpenRC.  A group of disgruntled-over-systemd users forked Debian and created Devuan.

systemd

cgroups - As I talked about near the end of the Process and Resource Management lecture, systemd is an enabler for cgroups and starts everything in a cgroup.  As a result the resource usage of CPU, RAM, and DISK are dynamically tunable (network coming in the future).  cgroups makes it easier and faster to reliably stop services.

journald - systemd decided to take on the logging facilities and as a result of the logging system being integrated into the init system and being able to have better access to the kernel, it can log all kernel messages including full startup and shutdown... a feat that was previously impossible.  It also uses a signle binary log file with database like functionality.  You can still run a traditional syslog program in parallel if desired to get the old-school, standard single log file per service text logs.  more abut logging in a separate lecture.

unit and target files - The traditional / original Unix / Linux init system SysVinit used shell scripts to control all services and there are many drawbacks.  systemd abandoned shell scripts and has much smaller, declarative configuration files named unit files.  SysVinit init had runlevels.  systemd abandoned runlevels and uses target files instead.  Available targets are emergency, rescue, multi-user (text-console only) and graphical (like multi-user but with a graphical login added).

core os concept - systemd decided to go beyond the strict boundaries of the traditional init system to incorporate more features that made sense for a system trying to make services and resources manageable.  The expansion of features has been dubbed, "Core OS" (not to be confused with the CoreOS Linux distribution) in that it tries to make common tasks the same across all distributions that use systemd.  There used to be several different programs used by distros for such things as logging in, managing user sessions, watchdog, cron, logging, setting the hostname etc.  This the most contentious aspect of systemd as some users think it has gone to far.

systemd programs / commands

The main control program for systemd is systemctl.

systemctl --full --all (lists everything)
systemctl enable {servicename}
systemctl disable {servicename}
systemctl status {servicename}
systemctl start {servicename}
systemctl stop {servicename}
systemctl mask {servicename (sysmlinks to /dev/null)
systemctl get-default (shows default target)
systemctl set-default {targetname} (changes the default target)
sysmtectl isolate {targetname} (change target)
sytemctl edit (add drop-in files for service customization)
